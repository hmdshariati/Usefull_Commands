# Design Patterns
## creational
abstract	->	Factory 

interface	->	Abstract Factory Builder focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. Abstract Factory specializes in creating families of related objects. Abstract Factory returns the product immediately, whereas Builder lets you run some additional construction steps before fetching the product.

interface	->	Builder

class   	->	Prototype

class   	->	Singleton (only one)

## structural
class   	->	Adapter (wrapper)

calss   	->	Bridge (divides)

class   	->	Composite

class   	->	Decorator (dynamically)

class   	->	Facade (simplified (but limited) )
